# MusicList

Live Site: https://p3musiclist.herokuapp.com/

My goal with this project was to get practice with React and APIs by recreating aspects of the spotify web app. Ultimately, I wanted to allow users to login, create playlists, and populate their playlists with songs from an API. 
Much of my time spent on this project was devoted to finding an API that would provide an extensive database of song titles, artists, song genres, and album covers. I ended up using the Musixmatch API because recieving an API key was quick and painless, but the information provided wasn't as complete as I would have liked.

## Future Iterations:

- Implement an API with more complete information
- Ability to play songs
- List of all playlist in a left-hand column (similar to Spotify)
- Scrolling slideshow of images on landing page
